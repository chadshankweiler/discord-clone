This is my notes and things i learn while doing this project. 

The tech stack that I'm using is Next.js, React, shadcn ui components, tailwind, 


Right off the bat, using tailwind I feel is pretty easy to use but also somewhat unnecessary. But I'll use it while following along with the project and maybe when i try to remake the roject I'll just use css. 

ShadCn ui seems to be pretty useful. Allowing me to download the components that i need and i can use different variants and create my own pretty easy.  



Interesting File System for routing using next.js

1. Create new folder to use it as routing
2. use `(file)` to use it as an organizational file



Authentication -> Clerk.com

This is a pretty interesting use case of middleware and holy does it make my life so much easier. Its incredible that it works that easy. I do want to explore creating my own auth and how to make it reuseable. 

I need to explore how the auth pipeline works and how to I can make it. Authentication and user management is a critical part of any service I build so I'll need to learn it thoroughly. 


Light and Dark Mode -> Shadcn

I had to install next-themes and utilize their packages and follow the configuration on shadcn. I can't understand why he set a static background though. 
Tailwind using a cn function as a way to merge styles and avoid conflicts of them. Its a good concept. 


Database:

Parisma and PlanetScale -> MySQL Database

How to deal with hydration errors. The guy didn't say why but only showed how to take out the errors using useState and useEffect to deal with it.

Using uploadthing.com for image uploads. 
I figure uploadthing is a wrapper on top of s3 buckets so I should learn how to use s3 buckets instead at some point.
